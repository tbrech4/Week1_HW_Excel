# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze real world Kickstarter data and help a playwright launch a Kickstarter of their own for their new play with a $10K budget.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In order to analyse outcomes by launch date, I first had to get a years column created. Converting a unix time stamp is something I hadn't done before - but I found it interesting! 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Most of the challenge for me came from getting the sumifs set up for the outcome by launch date analysis. It took a bit of work to get it setup, but I eventually got it. I also ran into some issues around edge cases, and did not include an 'or equal to' operator in my forumlas - so my data was off.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
